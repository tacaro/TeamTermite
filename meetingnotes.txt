Variables:
change density of food sources
distribution: lattice or random?

sigma02_array: determines the correlation in the random walk
	correlated random walk: extension of pure random walk. where an individual has a memory of its past travels. Change it to the value of pi to get pure random walk.

N_array: how much time it spends in the simulation: N is number of steps for the agent performing random walk.

number_of_nuts_array: change to number of termite mounds
box_limit: size of map
A_per_nut: area of each nut. nuts or termite mounds cannot be considered as points. must have volume.

CACHE_TYPE: "type of distrution" 2 is hexagonal lattice. 1 is random.
For now, we don't need to consider costs.

curr_realizations: important parameter. two stochastic aspects: distribution of food and navigation of agent. Need to repeat simulations with different random number seeds to get good stats on the simulation states. Need to define number of simulations to run.

x_initial/y_initial: define coordinates of where the agent starts. we want ours to start at the border. Though perhaps we start at the center for simplicity.

GOAL: want to plot trajectory that agent took.

Function: Lattice_Traj â€“ creates distribution of nuts on lattice.

Discrete or continuous food sources?
	Orit uses discrete nuts that occupy space. We will have to adapt to a continuous concentration of nutrition where grazers can still eat between the termite mounds.

Make pixel size correspond to fertilization circle. Real mounds are 4 pixels. We make the agent step size SMALLER than one pixel so that agents can have residence.

Quality vs. quantity of food:
3D matrix: x andn y are first two dimensions
3rd dimension is 1 layer per food type. 1 value of food source per pixel. 

GOAL: We should track both quantity and quality. As good food gets scarce, this should lead to a shift in behavior.
